# Blender_scripts
Some blender scripts
So far only tested with random small .stl files, should work for most 3D Files Blender can read. 
Create_sun... script is still work in progress, can be excecuted multiple times, will increase camera distance.
Intended order is: Import..., Merge_by_distance..., Create_sun...
